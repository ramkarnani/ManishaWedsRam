         <p class="story">
            Their paths crossed for the first time on 10th November, 2014 when a whatsapp group was created
            for managing the operations of <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/company/www-mentored-research-com" target="_blank">Mentored Research</a>, a startup 
            for which they both were working besides pursuing their engineering studies.
         </p>
         <p class="story">
            Manisha she got a crush on him right after seeing his profile picture on Whatsapp for the first time. Ram, however didn't feel the same -
            he rather thought her profile picture was taken off from some magazine. Due to the nature of their interactions as well as the fact that
            both lived in different cities and studied in different colleges, they could never really connect as anything more than friends.
            They met for the first time later in 2015 at a mutual friend's birthday, and it was then that Ram crushed on her too. However, being an introvert
            he could never express his feelings to her, and she too didn't try to break the ice thinking that he was uninterested.
         </p>
         <p class="story">
            Their story took a break as they both walked into different directions and could seldom talk, let alone meet.
         </p>
         <img src="./assets/img/11Nov.jpeg" class="ouPicImage" />
         <p class="story">
            Cupid struck an arrow in the summer of 2019 when the country was under lock down and Manisha posted a song on Facebook. Ram initiated a
            conversation on the post, and slowly both began to talk regularly. Within the next few months they got along as if they had known each other since forever.
            Unsurprisingly, it was sooner than later that they both realised - they were the ones made for each other. 
            On 11th November, 2020 both the families met each other for the first time and decided that it was a <i>perfect match</i>!
         </p>

         <p class="story">
            However, as she had always wanted a proposal to preceed the agreement of families, Ram went down on knees and proposed to her on 27th December, 2020 with <i>"The Ring"</i>.
